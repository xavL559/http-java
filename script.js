// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the userâ€™s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.

let personName = document.getElementById("name");

let background = document.getElementById("background-color");

let foreground = document.getElementById("foreground-color");


window.addEventListener("load", applyPreferences);

let form = document.querySelector("form");

    event.preventDefault();
    savePreferences();
    applyPreferences();
});

    localStorage.setItem("name", personName.value);
    localStorage.setItem("background", background.value);
    localStorage.setItem("foreground", foreground.value);
}

 {
    document.body.style.background = localStorage.getItem("background");
    document.body.style.color = localStorage.getItem("foreground");
    foreground.value = localStorage.getItem("foreground");
